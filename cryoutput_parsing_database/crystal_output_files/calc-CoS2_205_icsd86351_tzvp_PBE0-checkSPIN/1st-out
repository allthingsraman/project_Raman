 *******************************************************************************
 SECOND HYPERPOLARIZABILITY (GAMMA) IS RELATED TO THIRD ELECTRIC
         SUSCEPTIBILITY (CHI(3)) AS FOLLOWS:

                             CHI(3)=GAMMA*2PI/(3V)

         IN THE PRESENT CASE 2PI/3V =      0.0019

         GAMMA AND CHI(3) ARE EXPRESSED IN M^(-1)*L^4*T^2 AND IN F^(-2),
         RESPECTIVELY (L=LENGTH, M=MASS, T=TIME, F=FIELD). ATOMIC UNITS
         ARE USED.

         ELECTRIC SUSCEPTIBILITY IN THE THIRD HARMONIC GENERATION ( THG )
         CONVENTION IS CHI(3)(THG)=(1/4)*CHI(3).

              g(MKS)=CHI(3)(THG)*5.14220632^(-2)   (10^(-22) m^2/V^2)

              g(CGS)=CHI(3)(THG)*1.7152535^(-2)   (10^(-14) esu)

         (5.14220632*10^(11))^(-2) AND (4PI*1.7152535*10^7)^(-2) ARE THE CON-
         VERSION FACTORS FOR OBTAINING CHI(3)(THG) IN m^2/V^2 (MKS) AND
         esu (CGS), RESPECTIVELY: A FIELD WITH 1 A.U. MODULUS

                                  F=Q/(4PI*E0*R^2)

         CORRESPONDS TO  0.514220632*10^(11) V/m  (OR 1.7152535*10^7 esu),
         THEREFORE, CHI(3)(THG) IN MKS (OR CGS) CAN BE OBTAINED DIVIDING
         THE A.U. VALUE BY THE SQUARE OF THIS NUMBER.
         BECAUSE OF A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN DEFINITION

                             CHI(3)=P/(E0*F^3)   (MKS)

                             CHI(3)=P/F^3        (CGS)

         WHERE P IS  THE  POLARIZATION  VECTOR AND F THE APPLIED ELECTRIC
         FIELD, CONSISTENCY IS  PRESERVED BY MULTIPLYING THE CGS VALUE FOR
         THE CONSTANT PERMITTIVITY OF THE VACUUM, E0=1/(4PI).
