 ELECTRIC SUSCEPTIBILITY IN THE SECOND HARMONIC GENERATION (SHG) CONVENTION IS:
                   d(A.U.)= 1/2 CHI(2)
                   d(MKS) = d(A.U.)/0.514220632 pm/V
                   d(CGS) = d(A.U.)/(4PI*1.7152535)  10**(-7) esu

 FIELD INTENSITY: 1 A.U. = 0.514220632*10**(11) V/m = 1.7152535*10**7 esu
 BEWARE:                CHI(2)=P/(E0*F**2)   (MKS)
                        CHI(2)=P/F**2        (CGS)
 WHERE P IS THE POLARIZATION VECTOR AND F IS THE APPLIED ELECTRIC FIELD.
 CONSISTENCY IS  PRESERVED BY MULTIPLYING THE CGS VALUE TIMES THE PERMITTIVITY
 OF THE VACUUM, E0 (CONVERSION FACTORS FROM www.physics.nist.gov/constants).

 *******************************************************************************
 SECOND HYPERPOLARIZABILITY (GAMMA) IS RELATED TO THIRD ELECTRIC
         SUSCEPTIBILITY (CHI(3)) AS FOLLOWS:

                             CHI(3)=GAMMA*2PI/(3V)

         IN THE PRESENT CASE 2PI/3V =      0.0022

         GAMMA AND CHI(3) ARE EXPRESSED IN M^(-1)*L^4*T^2 AND IN F^(-2),
         RESPECTIVELY (L=LENGTH, M=MASS, T=TIME, F=FIELD). ATOMIC UNITS
         ARE USED.

         ELECTRIC SUSCEPTIBILITY IN THE THIRD HARMONIC GENERATION ( THG )
         CONVENTION IS CHI(3)(THG)=(1/4)*CHI(3).

              g(MKS)=CHI(3)(THG)*5.14220632^(-2)   (10^(-22) m^2/V^2)

              g(CGS)=CHI(3)(THG)*1.7152535^(-2)   (10^(-14) esu)

         (5.14220632*10^(11))^(-2) AND (4PI*1.7152535*10^7)^(-2) ARE THE CON-
         VERSION FACTORS FOR OBTAINING CHI(3)(THG) IN m^2/V^2 (MKS) AND
         esu (CGS), RESPECTIVELY: A FIELD WITH 1 A.U. MODULUS

                                  F=Q/(4PI*E0*R^2)

         CORRESPONDS TO  0.514220632*10^(11) V/m  (OR 1.7152535*10^7 esu),
         THEREFORE, CHI(3)(THG) IN MKS (OR CGS) CAN BE OBTAINED DIVIDING
         THE A.U. VALUE BY THE SQUARE OF THIS NUMBER.
         BECAUSE OF A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN DEFINITION

                             CHI(3)=P/(E0*F^3)   (MKS)

                             CHI(3)=P/F^3        (CGS)

         WHERE P IS  THE  POLARIZATION  VECTOR AND F THE APPLIED ELECTRIC
         FIELD, CONSISTENCY IS  PRESERVED BY MULTIPLYING THE CGS VALUE FOR
         THE CONSTANT PERMITTIVITY OF THE VACUUM, E0=1/(4PI).

 RAMAN INTENSITIES UNDER PLACZECK APPROXIMATION ARE COMPUTED AS:

  DIRECTIONAL (SINGLE CRYSTAL) :

     I_ij(n)= VOLUME*X(n,i,j)**2

  ISOTROPIC (POLYCRYSTALLINE POWDERS, GASES) :

     G_0(n) = 1/3*(SUM_i X(n,i,i))**2
     G_1(n) = 1/2*SUM_i,j (X(n,i,j)+X(n,j,i))**2
     G_2(n) = 1/3*SUM_i,j (X(n,i,i)-X(n,j,j))**2

     I_par(n)  = VOLUME*( 15*G_0(n) + 6*(G_1(n) + G_2(n)) )
     I_perp(n) = VOLUME*9/2*( G_1(n) + G_2(n) )
     I_tot(n)  = I_par(n) + I_perp(n)

  WHERE X(n,i,j) IS THE i,j-th COMPONENT OF THE RAMAN TENSOR
  IN THE BASIS OF NORMAL MODE n

  ALL VALUES ARE NORMALIZED TO THE MOST INTENSE PEAK


  INTENSITIES HAVE BEEN CALCULATED AT 
  TEMPERATURE                  :    298.0 K
  FREQUENCY OF INCOMING LASER  :    514.0 NM
