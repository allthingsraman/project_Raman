# project_Raman
Workflow code and output for computing Raman spectroscopy and properties related to lattice vibration using CRYSTAL.
## cif2cry
*cif2cry.py* converts ICSD CIF files to CRYSTAL input for vibrational spectroscopy calculations.
Atomic--orbital basis sets are collected from https://www.crystal.unito.it/basis_sets.html
*icsd_cif.txt* lists ICSD Collection Code, space group Hermann-Mauguin code, and chemical formula for all calculated compounds.
*cryinput* contains all CRYSTAL input files (.d12) generated by cif2cry.py
## cryoutput_parsing_databse
*crystal17_output_files* contains all CRYSTAL output files (.out) that include all the calculated thermodynamic and vibrational properties.
*crystal_out.py* parses the CRYSTAL output files.
*crystal_mongo.py* writes to and reads from our MongoDB database.
## web_interface
Web interface to interactively query compounds and visualize their Raman spectra.
